     <p> For this initial project, I wanted to capture what I think makes me, me. Featuring my experience in coding and other aspects related to the course, I also showcase some of my favorite photos that I have taken and collages I have made.</p>

     <p>For my second project, I decided to focus on the projected subject of my final project: ÜP Editorial. Displayed are editorial photos taken by Hannah Biel for various publications. I plan on making an interactive digitial issue of the magazine, combining my love for fashion, writing, and design with my new-found skill in coding. For this website, I experimented with photo collages and buttons.</p>

     <p> After reading Plato's <em>Allegory of the Cave</em>, I created choice-based game made interactive with the integration of buttons. Based on the story, the viewer can make decisions and ultimately decide their own fate. This was my first time utilizing a wire frame to plan my design.</p>

    <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-4">
           <p><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left;"> When I was presented with my first code, I was incredibly lost. However, as I learn new aspects with each project I complete, I am able to foster more and more creativity. I have learned ways to share creative aspects to myself such as fashion photography, digital collages, and creative storylines for interactive games through my web designs, but I know I can learn to make them more developed. I am incredibly excited to progress through each unit and see what I can accomplish by blending code and creative aspects. </p>
        </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>2. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">The first time I presented my project to the class, I was so nervous that I felt sick. Prior to the first day of class, I had never touched code, nor had I attempted. I know my skills are not as developed as those around me, that is why I have found myself actively engaging in the workshops with my peers. I want to work to better myself and therefore be able to create great, more creative projects that I am proud of. I am glad that I am no longer afraid to ask questions and learn from my classmates and their experience.</p>
        </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>3.	Think deeply about craft. </em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">Instead of simply copying and pasting code and inserting random photos and elements, I actually want to learn the ropes of code. I want to be able to create something fun and complex, and while I am proud of the projects I have created in phase one of the course, once I study and practice a little more, I will be able to make what I truly want to. As overwhelming as the new concept is to me, when deconstructed to just numbers and characters, it becomes more interesting and attainable. I have become fascinated with how one character can change an entire design, and I am intrigued in learning new ways to make more complex designs. </p>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>4. Engage in sustained research and skills development. </em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">As previously stated, I have had zero experience with code before enrolling in this course. That being said, I have had to watch all the instructional videos and even look a few things up. I know my work is not as impressive, but tackling simple code such as a button or photo collage is proof to me that I am furthering my skills. There have been plenty of times when I contemplated giving up, but I did not, and for that I am proud of my work and excited to see how I improve.</p>
        </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">Presenting your work is always nerve wracking - espeically when you are not proficient in the subject. However, through these first few classes, I have realized that I am proud to show what I have accomplished even if it is basic. I am able to show others my personality and creativity through my webtexts and my peers have been very receptive to my work. I have learned that it is okay to make mistakes when you are first starting out and criticism from my instructor and/or peers is good and will only help me grow.</p>

        <p>I utilized my photo essay as an opportunity to introduce my final project: an interactive issue of UP Editorial, a publication of my dear friend Hannah Beil. I compiled examples of a magazine I created digitally as well as samples of my own photography that reflect the content of UP Editorial.</p>

        <p>For my B-Roll Challenge, I decided to reminisce Summer 2023. I combined short clips from my time in Europe, home in Pittsburgh, and other places I traveled such as Chicago, set to "Good Days" by SZA - whom I saw in concert in London in June.</p>

       <p>I conducted an interview with UP Editorial's October coverstar, Jilly Rowan. Rowan is a senior at the University of Pittsburgh as well as a social media phenomena and fashion entrepenur. Together we discuss her future both in fashion and across the digital landscape. </p>

              <p>For this assignment, I decided to make a title sequence for UP Editorial. I utilized footage from my previous interview with Jilly Rowan, adding filters to the appearance and text transitions that allow the publication's name to pop quickly in and out of frame.</p>

           </a>
              <p>In After Effects, I made another title sequence for UP Editorial. This time, I was able to make my text "float," a play on the name "UP" itself. I plan on utilizing this technique in the cover page of my final project layered with a looped video.</p>

             <p>For my final "making" project, I decided to create a short, simple character animation. I chose a female avatar in the woods, introduced her as myself, fashion and beauty editor at UP Editorial, and added in effects that made her wave and shrug.</p>

     <h3 class="margin">Phase 2/3 Course Goals</h3>

  <h4><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></h4>
  <p>In phases 2 and 3, I was excited to see more visual media and less code. I have always enjoyed photography, especially that of fashion, so I loved both capturing new photographs and compiling previous works that reflect the lifestyle content of UP Editorial. In addition, I enjoyed taking videos and creating montages, exploring my new knack for Adobe's Premiere Pro software. I believe visual media is my strongpoint and best way to foster and display my creativity.</p>
     <br>
        <h4><em>2.	Engage with others in a workshop environment</em></h4>
  <p>More confident in my abilities pertaining to visual media such as photography and videography, I was not as nervous about workshopping with my peers. I love to showcase my work to my peers and review their media as well, giving each other inspiration moving forward in our projects. Although I am comfortable in my skills required of this portion of the portfolio, it does not mean I am closed off to constructive criticism nor am I opposed to learning new technology to enhance my media. Working with others who have more experience than me has allowed me to further my skills and grow more comfortable with Adobe software as well as mediums such as cameras.</p>
      <br>
        <h4><em>3.	Think deeply about craft</em></h4>
  <p>For me, my media is more than just a photograph, video, or graphic, everything I create means something to me and contains great personal influence. I focus on themes and aesthetics that resonate with me and the brand I am trying to both create and portray. These aesthetics then lead me to think deeply about the production of my media; exposure, filters, accompanying music, brightness, etc. All of these elements work cohesively to create a larger piece of art.</p>
      <br>
            <h4><em>4.	Engage in sustained research and skills development. </em></h4>
  <p>Although I have a background in media such as photography and videography, my skills were self-taught. Working on these projects prompted me to dig deeper into my craft, learning new skills when producing media as well as editing it. Reflective of the visual media presented within these phases of my portfolio, I researched topics such as fashion photography and the significance of fashion editorials, influencing the themes and elements behind my productions. In addition, I watched many Adobe tutorials and made time to explore software I was not familiar with, allowing me to create more advanced, impressive projects.</p>
      <br>
            <h4><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></h4>
  <p>After presenting to my classmates multiple times in phase one, I was not as shy for phases 2/3. More comfortable in both my people and production skills, I found myself excited to share the photos and videos that I captured and edited as well as graphics I worked hard to create. Instead of shying away from criticism, I have welcomed advice from my professor and peers with open arms, excited to then showcase how I have learned and perfected my work. The harder and longer I work, the more proud I am to share my creations with the class. </p>
